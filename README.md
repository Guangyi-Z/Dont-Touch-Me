Dont-Touch-Me
=============

Or named "Stay-In-Pockey", an android app that helps user focus on work and study by keeping your smart phone away.

##Goal

**Make the phone unavailable**, we want to create obstacles between phone and people

1. unable to touch it
2. unable to open the phone
3. unable to play specific apps

the fianl one is the securest way to accomplish this goal.
Your even not able to get the battery out of phone to stop this app from working.

##Impl

Considering users need to carry the phone when they are walking or moving, we figure out the phone **staying in your pocket** is an appropriate way to make it.(Or you also can simply put it on your desk with screen against desk, because **technically we make use of the Light sensor to detect user's behavior**)

NOTE: For user's demand, **this app allow user to use the phone when a phone call rings.** So just take it easy to answer your call :-P.
